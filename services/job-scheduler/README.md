# Job Scheduler Service

This service Schedules Jobs from the `JobService` and assignes them workers from the `WorkerRegistry` while using the carbon intensity data from the `CarbonIntensityProvider`.

This service has no API.

> **WARNING**
> The implementation is in an early stage. Some functionality may be missing or subject to change.

## Architecture

- `adapter/`: Handles HTTP Requests and contains the repository implementation for the in-memory-database.
- `core/`: Implements the logic for the `JobScheduler`
- `ports/`: Defines the `JobScheduler` interface as well as the `Adapter` interfaces and all required models.
- `utils/`: Contains some utility functions to make life easier
- `main.go`: Wires everything and starts the server
